# To run the program
simply run ./login.sh in the terminal

The first time the program is ran, you will automatically be logged in as admin so that the admin can change the default password. After the first login, the admin will have to login the same as everyone else. If there are any concerns, suggestions, or questions about how the code works, feel free to contact me.

# TO-DO List
* ~~Login system~~
* ~~Admin abilities~~
* ~~User abilities~~
* Access system

The only thing that needs functionality added to it is the access.sh file. The access.sh file gives the user the ability to open directories and files, create files, and delete files based on privilege.

# Colors
I added colors to the program to make it look better. Coloring seems to work natively on linux and on Windows using the windows subsystem for linux. I am unsure if it works for Macs, but I think that it should. Let me know if it does not work on Macs.
